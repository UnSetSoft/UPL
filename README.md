This repository contains the **UnSetSoft Public License (UPL 1.0)** and the  
**UnSetSoft Public License — Corporate Edition (UPL-CE 1.0)**.

Both licenses were created to provide an open, collaborative, and contribution-focused  
ecosystem while offering a clear commercial path for companies.

# 📘 Overview

The **UPL 1.0** is a *non-commercial, contribution-based* open-source license.  
It allows users to reuse parts of the code as long as they credit the source,  
but it places strict limitations on modification, distribution, and commercial use.

The **UPL-CE 1.0** is the *corporate* version of the license.  
It becomes active when a company subscribes to the paid tier:

> **“Get a company license for my project — $500/month”** (GitHub Sponsors)

With UPL-CE 1.0, companies gain commercial usage rights and permission to modify  
the software — **but all modifications must still be contributed back upstream.**

---

# 📄 Licenses Included

- **UPL 1.0** — for individual, hobby, research, and non-commercial usage  
- **UPL-CE 1.0** — required for companies using the software commercially

Both licenses respect external dependency licenses and require attribution.

# 🏢 Corporate Usage (UPL-CE 1.0)

If a company wants to:

✔ Use the software commercially  
✔ Modify it internally  
✔ Integrate it into a product  
✔ Redistribute compiled versions  

Then they **must** subscribe to the company tier and use **UPL-CE 1.0**.

When subscribing to the plan, the company automatically agrees to the terms  
of the Corporate Edition license.

If the subscription ends, the company:

- Loses commercial usage rights  
- Must stop shipping new releases containing the software  
- Reverts to the limitations of UPL 1.0  
- Must have contributed all modifications previously made

# 🔧 Why Two Licenses?

The split allows:

### ✨ Open collaboration  
Anyone can use part of the code for learning, hobby projects, research, and personal tools.

### 💼 Fair commercial usage  
Companies that benefit from the software’s value can support its development financially  
and contribute improvements.

### 🚀 Sustainable development  
UPL-CE ensures that professional usage becomes a source of funding and contributions.
